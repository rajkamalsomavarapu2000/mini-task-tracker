# mini-task-tracker
A minimal task tracker API designed for feature-based code extensions

## Feature Backlog

The following features are intentionally left unimplemented and are meant to be added incrementally:

- Task CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete)
- Task status support (pending, in_progress, done)
- Pagination and filtering for task listing
- API documentation improvements
- Basic test coverage for task endpoints

Each feature should be implemented as an extension of the existing codebase.
